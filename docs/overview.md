# Project Overview

The Number Guessing Game is a simple interactive Python application where the computer randomly selects a number and the user attempts to guess it. The program guides the player by giving hints and counts how many attempts were made.

This project demonstrates basic programming logic, Git version control, and GitHub repository management.
